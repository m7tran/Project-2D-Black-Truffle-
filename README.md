# Project-2D-Black-Truffle-
Scientific Question: Is it possible that the black Perigord truffle (Tuber melanosporum) and the Chinese black truffle (Tuber indicum) share similar protein expression profiles responsible for the production of the aromatic flavors such as 2 methylbutane?

Scientific Hypothesis: If the black Perigord truffle and the Chinese black truffle share similar protein expression profiles for their aromatic flavors, then volatiles and enzymes such as 2 methylbutane can be matched to the proteins obtained from these two truffles.

Methods/Outline of Project: Here we perform protein expression analysis, BLAST search and use a volcano plot and phylogenetic clustering to visualize the similarity of the truffle genome/sequence alignment respectively. Protein expression analysis is done to specify how the certain proteins of buth truffles are synthesized, modified, and regulated. BLAST search is done to identify similar regions between the sequences and compare the protein sequences to identify homologues of the two black truffles. A volcano plot and phylogenetic clustering are done to answer the scientific question about similar protein expression profiles of the truffleâ€™s aromatic flavors.
